# Coding Challenge Repository

## Introduction
👋 I'm Jello Mangune, a fresh graduate applying for an Associate Software Engineer position. I have experience with various programming languages, but I used Python to solve the challenges, which I used extensively in programming competitions during my school days.

## Overview
ℹ️ This repository contains solutions to coding challenges aimed at test algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

## Problem Sets

### Problem Set 1: Palindrome Pairs
🔍 Description: Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) such that the concatenation of words[i] and words[j] forms a palindrome.

### Problem Set 2: Valid Parentheses
🔍 Description: Given a string consisting of parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, determine if the string is valid. A string is valid if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type, and they are correctly nested.

### Problem Set 3: Longest Increasing Subsequence
🔍 Description: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

## Installation and Usage
🚀 To run the Python scripts:
1. Download and install Python from (https://www.python.org/).
2. Install Visual Studio Code (optional), and add the Python extension.
3. Open your Python script in Visual Studio Code, and press `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
4. Select "Python: Select Interpreter" and choose the installed Python interpreter.
5. Run the script using the IDE.

Alternatively, you can use an online Python compiler to execute the scripts directly from your browser.

👨🏽‍🦱 Happy coding!!!!
